#+TITLE: Image Search Engine
#+DESCRIPTION: Image Search Engine with Python and OpenCV

* Image Search Engine:
In normal Search Engine like Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing(lol) we use text to search the database(or Web), we simply enter a few keywords related to the content that we want to find and BAM the result.
But in Image Search Engine we use image instead of text to query the Database(or Web).

* Types Of ISE (Image Search Engine):
In general, there tend to be three types of image search engines:\\
(1) search by meta-data
(2) search by example
(3) hybrid approach of the two

** Search By Meta-Data
Search by meta-data systems rarely examine the contents of the image itself. Instead, they rely on textual clues such as\\ 
(1) Manual annotations and tagging performed by humans  
(2) Automated contextual hints, such as the text that appears near the image on a webpage

** Search By Example
Search by example systems, on the other hand, rely solely on the contents of the image â€” no keywords are assumed to be provided. The image is analyzed, quantified, and stored so that similar images are returned by the system during a search.

** Hybrid Approach Of The Two
hybrid image search engine includes both text keywords along with features extracted from the images.

* Dataset Used To Test The Program

* The Task
The task for this program is to be used as a Image Search Engine for a Database/Dataset

* How To Use
I recomend you read the code (Code is well Defined and Commented) To understand How this program works (Or Wait for my Youtube tutorial/video when this project is compeleted)

** Step 1:
install Python3, pip and git \\

Linux
#+BEGIN_SRC Bash
    # For Debian and Ubuntu Users
    sudo apt install python3
    sudo apt install python3-pip
    sudo apt install git
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC Bash
    # For Arch Users
    sudo pacman -S python # Default python in arch is python3 not python2.7
    sudo pacman -S python-pip
    sudo pacman -S git
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC Bash
    # For Fedora Users
    sudo dnf install python3
    sudo dnf install python3-pip
    sudo dnf install git
#+END_SRC

Compile It From Source : [[https://www.unixmen.com/howto-install-python-3-x-in-ubuntu-debian-fedora-centos/]] \\

MacOS\\

From This link Download the latest python3 for MacOS: [[https://www.python.org/]] \\

Or Use Homebrew
#+BEGIN_SRC Bash
    # To install Homebrew on MacOS
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC Bash
    # To install Python3 on MacOS using Homebrew
    brew install python
    # or brew install python3
    brew install git
#+END_SRC
this will autometically install pip as well you might see there is no pip then try to use pip3 \\

Windows\\

Got to this link and Download and install python3 for windows :  [[https://www.python.org/]] (I personally preffer linux-subsystem)


* Step 2
Install python requirements using pip/pip3

#+BEGIN_SRC Bash
    pip install -r requirements
    # you can also use sudo in mac and linux to install as root but i don't suggest you do it
#+END_SRC

* Step 3
Download the git-repo

#+BEGIN_SRC Bash
    git clone https://gitlab.com/saurabhtanwar/image-search-engine.git
    # then go into git directory
    cd image-search-engine
#+END_SRC

* Step 4 
Index your Image Dataset for learning
#+BEGIN_SRC Bash
    python index.py --dataset <image-dataset-directory> --index index.csv # index.csv is out file for indexing
#+END_SRC

* Step 5
Now Use Image Search Engine
#+BEGIN_SRC Bash
    python search.py --index index.csv --query <Loacation of image to use a query/searching perameter> --result-path <image-dataset-directory>
#+END_SRC

* This project is not fully compeleted 
(As per my vision... It works but i want to make it so that it can search several shoping wesites and then arrenge data or products using 2 perameters i.e. More accurate products and more cheaper products)
